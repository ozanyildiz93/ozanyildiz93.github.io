Hi! I am a second year PhD student at the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne, where I am advised by [Prof. Nisheeth K. Vishnoi](https://theory.epfl.ch/vishnoi/Home.html). 

I am interested in problems at the intersection of Machine Learning and Theoretical Computer Science. I have worked on or am currently working on problems related to geodesically convex optimization and maximum entropy distributions.

Before EPFL, I received my Bachelors degrees in Mathematics and Computer engineering, as well as my Masters degrees in Computer Engineering from Middle East Technical University, Ankara under the supervision of [Prof. Fatoş T. Yarman-Vural](https://vural.ceng.metu.edu.tr).
